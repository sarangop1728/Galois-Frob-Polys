The list of (roots,valuations) of P in the splitting field L, with respect to an indexing of the roots (bar(j) = 2d+1-j, and nondecreasing valuations with respect to some prime pp above p in L). 2. The Galois group H of P, as a permutation group on the roots of P, with respect to the indexing chosen in (1). 3. The complex conjugation element cc of H. 4.
